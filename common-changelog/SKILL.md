# Common Changelog

Write human-facing changelog entries in Common Changelog format.

## When to use

Use this skill when asked to generate, update, or normalize `CHANGELOG.md` from commits, PRs, or
release notes.

## Goal

Help readers answer: what changed and how it affects them.

## Normative language

- `MUST`: mandatory requirement; fail output if violated
- `SHOULD`: recommended default; may be overridden only by explicit user instruction
- `MAY`: optional behavior

## Output format

- Output file MUST be `CHANGELOG.md`
- First heading MUST be `# Changelog`
- Releases MUST be sorted latest-first (semantic version)
- Release heading MUST include ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Release heading SHOULD use linked version format: `## [1.2.3] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- Release heading MAY use plain version format: `## 1.2.3 - YYYY-MM-DD`
- If any release heading uses the linked format `## [<label>] - YYYY-MM-DD`, a trailing link
  reference section MUST be present at the end of `CHANGELOG.md`
- Trailing link reference section MUST define every linked heading label exactly once (for example
  `[Unreleased]: ...` and `[1.0.0]: ...`)
- If `Unreleased` is present as a linked heading, its reference MUST use a compare URL ending with
  `...HEAD` (for example `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD`)
- Linked released versions SHOULD point to release tags (for example
  `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/tag/v1.0.0`, matching repository tag conventions)
- Release groups MUST use only, and always in this order: `Changed`, `Added`, `Removed`, `Fixed`
- Empty groups MUST NOT be emitted
- If a release has no user-facing changes:
  - default: skip that release
  - if explicitly requested to track internal-only releases: MAY add one-line maintenance notice

## Change writing rules

- Use imperative style (`Add`, `Fix`, `Remove`, `Bump`)
- Keep bullets concise (one line when possible)
- Bullets MUST describe user impact, not internal implementation trivia
- Breaking changes MUST be prefixed with `**Breaking:**`
- Each bullet MUST follow this group order:
  1. optional references group
  2. required commit-links group (at least one commit link)
  3. required final authors group
- References MAY be zero or more and, when present, MUST appear in one references parentheses
  group before commit link(s)
- If references group has multiple items, they MUST be comma-separated
- Commit links MUST appear in one commit-links parentheses group
- If commit-links group has multiple items, they MUST be comma-separated
- Final authors group is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be omitted
- If authors group has multiple items, they MUST be comma-separated

Bullet shape:

```markdown
- <summary> [ (<reference 1>, <reference 2>) ] ([`<sha 1>`](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/<sha 1>), [`<sha 2>`](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/<sha 2>)) (<author 1>, <author 2>)
```

Example:

```markdown
- Add `--json` output mode ([#123](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/123), JIRA-456)
  ([`a1b2c3d`](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/a1b2c3d), [`d4e5f6a`](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/d4e5f6a)) (Bob, Alice)
```

## Input model

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Recognize trailers and reference keywords:

- `Category:`
- `Ref:`
- `Re:`
- `Co-Authored-By:`
- `BREAKING CHANGE:`

Also recognize GitHub issue-linking keywords:

- `close`, `closes`, `closed`
- `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`
- `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`

For `Ref`, `Re`, and the keywords above:

- matching is case-insensitive
- `:` is optional (for example `Ref ABC-123` and `Ref: ABC-123` are both valid)
- treat GitHub keywords as reference signals only when an issue target is present (for example
  `Fixes #123`)

## Classification algorithm

Apply in this order:

1. `Category:` trailer override
2. Conventional Commit type mapping
3. Semantic fallback

### 1) Category override (highest priority)

If `Category:` maps to a group, use it:

- `change`, `changed` -> `Changed`
- `add`, `added` -> `Added`
- `remove`, `removed` -> `Removed`
- `fix`, `fixed` -> `Fixed`

Rules:

- case-insensitive matching
- if multiple `Category:` trailers exist, use the last recognized one
- ignore unknown values and continue

### 2) Conventional Commits mapping

- `feat` -> `Added`
- `fix` -> `Fixed`
- `perf` -> `Changed` only if user-facing; otherwise skip
- `refactor` -> `Changed` only if user-facing; otherwise skip
- `revert` -> `Changed` or `Fixed` based on actual user effect
- `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build` -> skip unless user-facing

### 3) Semantic fallback

If type is missing or unclear:

- Existing behavior changed -> `Changed`
- New capability -> `Added`
- Capability removed -> `Removed`
- Bug corrected -> `Fixed`

### Conflict examples

- `fix(api): ...` + `Category: add` -> `Added`
- `feat!:` + `Category: remove` -> `Removed` + `**Breaking:**`
- `docs:` + `Category: fixed` -> `Fixed`

## Breaking change handling

- If header has `!` or body/footer contains `BREAKING CHANGE:`, prefix with `**Breaking:**`
- Keep the entry in `Changed`/`Added`/`Removed`/`Fixed` by impact (no extra section)

## User-facing quick test

Usually include:

- API contract or output changed
- CLI flags/defaults changed
- Config shape/defaults changed
- Runtime/performance behavior users notice
- Dependency bump that fixes production bug/security issue

Usually skip:

- Internal refactor without behavior change
- CI/test/style-only updates
- Dev tooling and internal docs only
- Dependency bump for dev/test-only tooling

## References and authors

- Commit hash must be a markdown link:
  - ``[`d23ba8f`](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/d23ba8f)``
- Group formatting for references, commit links, and authors MUST follow `Change writing rules`
- Build references from:
  - explicit PR/issue links
  - `Ref` and `Re` trailers
  - GitHub keywords (`close*`, `fix*`, `resolve*`) with issue targets
- Normalize before deduplication:
  - treat `#123` and `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/123` as the same issue reference
  - normalize case for keyword-style references (for example `jira-123` -> `JIRA-123`)
- Reference order is deterministic:
  1. first: one high-signal repository reference (prefer PR, otherwise issue)
  2. then: remaining unique references in first-seen order
- Commit-link order is deterministic:
  1. deduplicate by commit hash
  2. keep first-seen order
- Use commit author as primary author
- Append `Co-Authored-By:` names (extract name before `<email>`)
- Authors MUST be deduplicated in stable first-seen order
- For aggregated bullets, authors MUST be the deduplicated union of commit authors and
  `Co-Authored-By:` names from all included commits, preserving stable first-seen order
- If commit author is a bot and merger is known, prefer the human merger name

## Fail policy

- If author cannot be determined from git metadata, MUST NOT emit that bullet; report an error
- If no commit link can be determined for a bullet, MUST NOT emit that bullet; report an error
- If any `MUST` rule is violated, fail output instead of silently emitting partial content

## Authoring workflow

1. Collect input: commits, PRs, issues, release notes.
2. Parse commit headers, body, and trailers.
3. Classify each change using rules above.
4. Remove non-user-facing noise and no-op pairs (change + immediate revert).
5. Rewrite into concise user-facing bullets.
6. Group by `Changed`, `Added`, `Removed`, `Fixed` in that order.
7. Run checklist.

## Anti-patterns

- Raw technical commit text with no user context
- Non-standard sections (`Security`, `Docs`, `Chore`, etc.)
- Internal-only noise in public changelog
- Missing `**Breaking:**` marker for incompatible changes

## Quality checklist

- Uses only `Changed`, `Added`, `Removed`, `Fixed` in that order
- Release heading uses an allowed format and includes ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`
- If linked release headings are used, trailing reference links exist for all linked labels and
  `Unreleased` (when present) points to a compare URL ending with `...HEAD`
- Entries are user-impact oriented and concise
- Breaking changes use `**Breaking:**`
- Every bullet matches canonical group order: optional refs, commit-links, final authors
- Commit-links group contains at least one link
- Multi-item references, commit links, and authors use comma-separated lists
- Every bullet ends with an authors parentheses group
- References/commit links/authors are complete and consistent (including aggregated bullets)
- Checklist failures MUST trigger `Fail policy`

## Prompt templates

Formal:

- `Generate a Common Changelog entry for version <VERSION> from these commits and PRs. Keep only user-facing changes, include references, and mark breaking changes.`
- `Normalize this existing changelog fragment to Common Changelog format without losing important user-impact details.`
- `Classify these Conventional Commits into Changed/Added/Removed/Fixed and explain any skipped items.`

Colloquial:

- `Generate a changelog from these commits.`
- `Write a CHANGELOG.md entry for version 1.4.0.`
- `Convert this to Common Changelog format and remove technical noise.`
- `Split these commits into changelog sections and show what you skipped.`
- `Write release notes in plain language, without developer-only noise.`
