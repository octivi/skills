description: Draft, rewrite, and review Git commit messages using Conventional Commits and commit hygiene rules. Use whenever the user asks for commit text, commit message fixes, type/scope selection, breaking-change notation, trailers (for example See or Co-authored-by), splitting work into atomic commits, or commit readiness before a PR, even if they ask in informal terms like "polish this commit message".

# Git Commits

Write clear, structured commit messages that explain what changed and why.

## Goal

Help readers and tools quickly understand commit intent, impact, and context.

## Canonical rules table

Use this table as the single source of truth.

| ID       | Scope                     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FMT-1`  | Message shape             | Commit message MUST follow: `<type>[optional scope]: <subject>`, optional body, optional footer(s), with blank lines between sections.                                                                                                                         |
| `FMT-2`  | Allowed types             | Type MUST be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `revert`.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `FMT-3`  | Header length             | Header SHOULD be <= 50 chars and MUST be <= 72 chars.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `FMT-4`  | Subject style             | Subject MUST be imperative/present tense and MUST NOT end with a period.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `FMT-5`  | Breaking changes          | If the commit introduces a breaking API change, header MUST use `!` and message MUST include `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` with migration impact.                                                                                                           |
| `FMT-6`  | Scope                     | Scope is optional and SHOULD be used when it improves clarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `FMT-7`  | Unsupported type requests | If the requested type is outside the allowed set, output MUST map to the closest allowed type. In `rewrite` and `review` modes, output MUST explicitly explain the mapping; in `draft` mode, explanation SHOULD be omitted unless the user asks for rationale. |
| `BODY-1` | Body usage                | Body is optional; when present it MUST explain motivation, context, and behavior change (not only implementation detail).                                                                                                                                      |
| `BODY-2` | Body formatting           | Body SHOULD wrap normal prose at ~72 chars per line; long URLs and terminal snippets MAY exceed this.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `FTR-1`  | Trailer format            | Footers/trailers SHOULD follow `Token: value` (or `Token #value`) so they remain compatible with `git interpret-trailers`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `FTR-2`  | Tracking links            | Use `See:` trailers for tracker/docs/reference URLs; emit one URL per line.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `FTR-3`  | Co-authors                | Use `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` trailers when multiple people co-authored the change.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `REV-1`  | Reverts                   | `revert` commits SHOULD repeat reverted header and body SHOULD include `This reverts commit <hash>.`                                                                                                                                                           |
| `HYG-1`  | Atomicity                 | Commits SHOULD be small, logical, and atomic; avoid mixing unrelated changes.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `HYG-2`  | Whitespace changes        | Significant whitespace-only changes SHOULD be in a separate commit.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `HYG-3`  | Tests                     | If code changes require test updates, include test updates in the same commit.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Semver intent by type

- `feat` -> minor version intent
- `fix` -> patch version intent
- `docs` -> patch version intent
- `refactor` -> no release bump intent
- `chore` -> no release bump intent
- `revert` -> depends on reverted change impact

## Input model

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Output contract

Choose exactly one mode based on user intent:

1. `draft`
   - Output only one final commit message, ready to paste into `git commit`.
   - Do not add explanatory prose unless the user explicitly asks for explanation.
2. `rewrite`
   - Output one rewritten commit message first.
   - Then provide a short `Why this is better` list focused on violated rule IDs.
3. `review`
   - Output `Findings` first, ordered by severity and linked to rule IDs.
   - If fixes are needed, include `Proposed message` after findings.

## Unsupported type mapping

If a user asks for a non-supported type, keep the intent but map to allowed types:

- `feature` -> `feat`
- `bugfix`, `hotfix` -> `fix`
- `perf` -> `refactor`
- `style`, `test`, `ci`, `build` -> `chore`

When mapping is used in `rewrite` or `review`, explicitly state:
`Mapped requested type <x> to <y> to satisfy FMT-2`.

## Type compatibility with other skills

- This skill enforces a strict output type set (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`,
  `revert`) per `FMT-2`.
- This restriction applies to messages authored/rewritten by this skill, not to historical commits
  that may already use broader Conventional Commit variants.
- The `common-changelog` skill MAY ingest broader input types from history (`perf`, `style`, `test`,
  `ci`, `build`) and classify them for changelog purposes.

## Authoring workflow

1. Identify the smallest logical change set; recommend split commits if input is too broad.
2. Choose `type` (and optional `scope`) by user impact.
3. If requested type is unsupported, apply `Unsupported type mapping` and explain why.
4. Draft concise imperative subject.
5. Add body only when extra context is needed; explain why and behavior delta.
6. Add footers/trailers (`See:`, `Co-authored-by:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) as needed.
7. Run `Quality checklist`.

## Quality checklist

- Validate all applicable `FMT-*`, `BODY-*`, `FTR-*`, `REV-*`, and `HYG-*` rules.
- Ensure final message is copy-paste ready for `git commit`.
- Ensure unsupported type requests are mapped and explained when required by output mode.
- For detailed conventions and more examples, verify against `references/git-commit.md`.

## Prompt templates

- `Write a Conventional Commit message for these staged changes.`
- `Rewrite this commit message to follow Conventional Commits and explain why your version is better.`
- `Split this change into 2-3 atomic commits and propose a commit message for each.`
